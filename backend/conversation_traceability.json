    "primary_unresolved_objection": "The student is worried their five years of experience as a QA Engineer might create a significant gap, questioning if the program can truly help someone with their specific background secure a good job in AI and provide a clear path to job security in a high-growth scope.",
    "mistakes": [
      "The counsellor failed to proactively address the potential concerns a QA Engineer might have about transitioning to AI, despite the student explicitly stating their QA background in the first round.",
      "The response regarding placement assistance was general, not specifically tailored to how the program has successfully transitioned individuals with a similar five-year QA background into AI roles.",
      "Did not delve deeper into the student's specific fears or anxieties about their background before providing the general program overview, leading to a strong, personalized objection at the end of the round."

    "strengths": [
      "The counsellor effectively acknowledged and validated the student's career aspirations and the desire for growth and stability.",
      "Provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the program curriculum, its benefits (job-readiness, industry certification), and practical projects.",
      "Clearly addressed both of the student's initial key questions regarding placement assistance (including eligibility, support, and statistics) and financial commitment (fees, concessions, EMI, loan facilities).",
      "Maintained a professional and informative tone throughout the interaction.",
      "Used a compelling statistic (97% placement) to highlight program success."
    ],
    "why": "The counsellor provided a detailed overview of the program, placement assistance, and financial options, which the student acknowledged as helpful and promising. However, the counsellor failed to proactively or adequately address the student's specific, deeply-rooted concern about their 5-year QA background and its impact on securing an AI job after the program. The student's primary unresolved objection clearly indicates they are not yet convinced the program is the right fit for *them* given their unique professional history.",
    "skill_recommendations": [
      "**Active Listening and Empathy:** The counsellor needs to listen more attentively to underlying anxieties (e.g., job security fears related to specific background) and demonstrate greater empathy, moving beyond just acknowledging aspirations.",
      "**Proactive Objection Handling:** Based on the student's profile (QA background, 5 years experience), the counsellor should have anticipated and proactively addressed potential concerns about transition success for such profiles, perhaps by sharing relevant success stories or tailored information.",
      "**Customized Value Proposition:** Instead of a generic program pitch, the counsellor should aim to customize the value proposition by connecting program features directly to the student's specific background and career transition needs.",
      "**Evidence-Based Reassurance:** Provide specific case studies or testimonials of former QA engineers who successfully transitioned through the program to directly mitigate the student's concerns about their background."

      "content": "Thank you for sharing your career aspirations. It's completely understandable to seek growth and stability, especially after five years in a QA role where you feel advancement is limited. The drive to transition into a high-growth area like AI, particularly Agentic AI, is a strategic and promising move for long-term career security.\nThe NIIT Building Agentic AI Systems program is specifically positioned to develop job-ready capabilities for high-growth AI and automation roles. It focuses on designing, building, and deploying real-world Agentic AI systems using modern LLM frameworks, leading to an industry-recognized certification that signals job-readiness. The curriculum is designed to bridge software engineering and applied AI system development, guiding learners from building clean APIs to designing intelligent, autonomous agents. It covers modules such as Python for AI Embedded Applications, Intelligent Conversational Agents, RAG-Based Systems, and Autonomous Multi-agent Systems, culminating in a Capstone Project. You'll work on industry-relevant projects like building a Multi-Agent System for Code Review & Optimization or a Multi-Agent Software Customer Support with Human in the Loop, which helps you build a strong portfolio of working AI projects.\nRegarding your question about placement, NIIT provides placement assistance for eligible learners. To qualify, you would need to complete the program with at least a 70% score, hold a regular graduation degree, and reside in India. Given your five years of experience, this support would include access to placement preparation sessions, mentor guidance, and up to three interview opportunities within 120 days of program completion. While NIIT facilitates job opportunities and partners with over 800 hiring partners, final selection ultimately depends on your performance in interviews and the specific requirements of the employer. NIIT states that 97% of eligible learners have been placed.\nFor the financial commitment, the program fee is INR 1,50,000 plus GST. We offer a 5% concession, which is INR 7,500 off, if you choose to make a full upfront payment, bringing the fee to INR 1,42,500 plus GST. Alternatively, EMI options are available, with equal installments of INR 24,750 plus GST after the initial booking fee. Loan facilities are also facilitated through third-party lenders. It's important to note that NIIT has no role in the loan approval process; that depends on the lender's eligibility criteria and documentation. You would need to review the loan terms carefully, including EMIs, interest rates, processing fees, and repayment schedules, directly with the lender.\nDoes this initial overview help clarify how the program addresses your career goals and the associated financial aspects?",
