      "content": "That's excellent to hear, as a Full Stack Developer with a drive to stay ahead and build scalable solutions, you're perfectly aligned with what the 'Building Agentic AI Systems' program aims to achieve. It's designed to bridge your strong software engineering background with the cutting-edge of applied AI system development, specifically focusing on GenAI and agentic systems.\nYou mentioned \"LangChain\" and \"Streamlit\"—these are indeed key tools covered within the curriculum. You'll work with `LangChain`, `Streamlit`, and over 25 other tools and frameworks to build real-world AI projects.\nThe program guides you from building clean APIs to designing intelligent, autonomous agents. The curriculum includes core modules like:\n*   `Python for AI-Embedded Applications`\n*   `Build and Deploy Intelligent Conversational Agents`\n*   `Build RAG-Based Systems`\n*   `Build Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems`\n*   Culminating in a `Capstone Project: Engineer an Autonomous Agentic AI System (SLO-Bound)`.\nThrough these, you'll gain the capabilities to write clean, modular Python code, develop intelligent conversational AI agents, build RAG systems using organizational data, and design multi-agent systems that plan, act, and collaborate. The capstone project, for instance, involves designing and building a production-grade autonomous AI system, allowing you to showcase a portfolio of working AI projects.\nRegarding the program structure, it comprises 300 hours of guided learning and practice, typically spanning 19 to 25 weeks, depending on whether you opt for 4 or 3 sprints per week. Each sprint involves 2 hours of live mentor-led sessions and 2 hours of self-paced practice, with approximately 70% of the total time dedicated to hands-on work. This means you'd be looking at a weekly time commitment of around 12-16 hours.\nNow, concerning your crucial question about placement support and pricing:\nFor eligible learners who achieve at least a 70% score, hold a regular graduation degree, and reside in India, placement assistance is available. This support includes up to three interview opportunities within 120 days for those with 6 months to 5 years of experience, along with access to placement preparation sessions and mentor guidance. For learners with over 5 years of experience, career guidance is provided. It's important to note that while we facilitate these opportunities, final selection always depends on your performance and the specific requirements of the employer.\nRegarding the program fee, it is `INR 1,50,000 + 18% GST`. If you opt for full upfront payment, there's a 5% concession, making the fee `INR 1,42,500 + 18% GST`. We also offer flexible payment options. You can pay through easy installments, or you can explore loan facilities through third-party lenders. Please remember that loan approval is subject to the lender's eligibility criteria, and NIIT does not guarantee loan approval.\nDoes this breakdown clarify the program structure, curriculum, placement support, and pricing for you?",

You'll also have access to placement preparation sessions and mentor guidance, which are crucial for refining your interview skills and portfolio.

If you choose the full upfront payment option, with the 5% concession, the total fee including GST is INR 1,68,150. For the EMI option, we offer easy installments, with one option being INR 24,750 per equal installment after the booking fee.

This can vary based on the specific installment plan you select directly through us, or the terms provided by third-party lenders, if you opt for a loan through them. It is important to review all loan terms carefully, including interest rates, processing fees, and repayment schedules, as NIIT does not guarantee loan approval and has no role in the loan facilitation process beyond connecting you with potential lenders.\nDoes this further clarify the placement support structure and the financial options for you?",

      "content": "That's excellent to hear, as a Full Stack Developer with a drive to stay ahead and build scalable solutions, you're perfectly aligned with what the 'Building Agentic AI Systems' program aims to achieve. It's designed to bridge your strong software engineering background with the cutting-edge of applied AI system development, specifically focusing on GenAI and agentic systems.\nYou mentioned \"LangChain\" and \"Streamlit\"—these are indeed key tools covered within the curriculum. You'll work with `LangChain`, `Streamlit`, and over 25 other tools and frameworks to build real-world AI projects.\nThe program guides you from building clean APIs to designing intelligent, autonomous agents. The curriculum includes core modules like:\n*   `Python for AI-Embedded Applications`\n*   `Build and Deploy Intelligent Conversational Agents`\n*   `Build RAG-Based Systems`\n*   `Build Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems`\n*   Culminating in a `Capstone Project: Engineer an Autonomous Agentic AI System (SLO-Bound)`.\nThrough these, you'll gain the capabilities to write clean, modular Python code, develop intelligent conversational AI agents, build RAG systems using organizational data, and design multi-agent systems that plan, act, and collaborate. The capstone project, for instance, involves designing and building a production-grade autonomous AI system, allowing you to showcase a portfolio of working AI projects.\nRegarding the program structure, it comprises 300 hours of guided learning and practice, typically spanning 19 to 25 weeks, depending on whether you opt for 4 or 3 sprints per week. Each sprint involves 2 hours of live mentor-led sessions and 2 hours of self-paced practice, with approximately 70% of the total time dedicated to hands-on work. This means you'd be looking at a weekly time commitment of around 12-16 hours.\nNow, concerning your crucial question about placement support and pricing:\nFor eligible learners who achieve at least a 70% score, hold a regular graduation degree, and reside in India, placement assistance is available. This support includes up to three interview opportunities within 120 days for those with 6 months to 5 years of experience, along with access to placement preparation sessions and mentor guidance. For learners with over 5 years of experience, career guidance is provided. It's important to note that while we facilitate these opportunities, final selection always depends on your performance and the specific requirements of the employer.\nRegarding the program fee, it is `INR 1,50,000 + 18% GST`. If you opt for full upfront payment, there's a 5% concession, making the fee `INR 1,42,500 + 18% GST`. We also offer flexible payment options. You can pay through easy installments, or you can explore loan facilities through third-party lenders. Please remember that loan approval is subject to the lender's eligibility criteria, and NIIT does not guarantee loan approval.\nDoes this breakdown clarify the program structure, curriculum, placement support, and pricing for you?",
