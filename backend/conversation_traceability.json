This program is specifically designed to address those needs by providing job-ready skills for high-growth AI and automation roles.\nThe \"Building Agentic AI Systems\" program offers a strong foundation by focusing on designing, building, and deploying real-world Agentic AI systems. You will gain capabilities to accelerate innovation, write clean, modular Python code, develop conversational AI agents, build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems using organizational data, and design and orchestrate complex multi-agent systems. The curriculum bridges software engineering and applied AI system development, guiding learners from building clean APIs to designing intelligent, autonomous agents. You'll work on industry-relevant projects, such as Multi-Agent Systems for Code Review & Optimization, Software Customer Support with Human in the Loop, and Agentic AI Candidate Assessment Systems, which will build a solid portfolio to showcase your readiness for applied AI development roles.\nRegarding placement, we provide placement assistance for eligible learners. This support includes access to placement preparation sessions, mentor guidance, and up to three interview opportunities within 120 days for learners with 6 months to 5 years of experience. For those with over 5 years of experience, like yourself, career guidance is provided. Our data shows that 97% of eligible learners are placed. To be eligible for this assistance, learners must complete the program with at least a 70% score, hold a regular graduation degree, and reside in India. While we facilitate opportunities through our 800 hiring partners, final selection is always dependent on your performance during interviews and the employer's specific requirements. This program is practitioner-designed and built for job readiness to help you transition effectively into the AI domain.",

However, I noticed that for learners with \"over 5 years of experience,\" like myself, it mentions \"career guidance\" instead of the \"up to three interview opportunities\" provided for those with 6 months to 5 years of experience. Could you please elaborate on what this \"career guidance\" specifically entails for my batch? I am particularly concerned about the robustness of the placement guarantee for someone with my experience and background, given my primary motivation is a clear path to job security in the AI domain. Will I still be considered for direct placements, or is it more of a self-driven job search with some advice?",

It feels like a subtle way of saying direct job interviews might not be as readily available for older batches or those with a \"gap\" like mine. It almost confirms my fear that I'm too old for a smooth transition. The 97% placement statistic sounds good, but \"eligible learners\" and then \"career guidance\" for my experience bracket feels like a loophole. I need more clarity on how exactly my \"batch\" will be supported for direct placement, not just guidance. I am still very worried about job guarantee. This is making me panic a bit about my investment.",
