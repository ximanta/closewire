      "content": "Hello! I appreciate your directness and your focus on value for money and return on investment. It's completely understandable to look beyond the hype, especially when considering a significant investment in your career. Let's address your main concerns about job prospects and pricing based on the program's factual data.\nRegarding your question about job prospects and guarantees, the \"Building Agentic AI Systems\" program is designed with job readiness in mind. It builds role-specific competencies and is practitioner-designed to accelerate skill acquisition through a \"Learn by Doing\" approach, where over 60% of program time is invested in coding and hands-on practical activities. You'll work on industry-relevant projects, including a Capstone Project to engineer an autonomous Agentic AI system, which allows you to build a portfolio of working AI projects demonstrating your readiness for applied AI development roles.\nUpon successful completion, you'll receive an Industry-recognized NIIT Certificate in Agentic AI. For eligible learners who complete the program with at least a 70% score, hold a regular graduation degree, and reside in India, placement assistance is available. This support includes up to three interview opportunities within 120 days for those with 6 months to 5 years of experience, career guidance for those with over 5 years of experience, and access to placement preparation sessions and mentor guidance. While NIIT provides these opportunities, final selection depends on your performance and employer requirements. According to our data, 97% of eligible learners were placed.\nNow, concerning the program fee and any hidden charges. The program fee is INR 1,50,000 + GST, along with a booking fee of INR 1,500 + GST. These are the stated fees from NIIT, and there are no hidden charges. We offer multiple payment options:\n*   If you choose to pay the full program fee upfront, there's a 5% concession, making the program fee component INR 1,42,500 + GST.\n*   EMI options are available for INR 24,750 in equal installments after booking.\n*   Additionally, loan facilities can be availed through third-party lenders. It's important to note that loan approval depends on the lender's eligibility criteria, and NIIT does not guarantee loan approval. All loan terms, including EMIs, interest rates, and repayment schedules, are to be reviewed carefully with the lender directly.\nDoes this clarify your initial concerns about the program's value proposition, placement assistance, and fee structure?",

      "content": "Thank you for pointing out the figure confusion; I apologize for any misunderstanding. Let me clarify the exact program fee with GST for you.\nThe standard program fee is INR 1,50,000, and the booking fee is INR 1,500. Both are subject to 18% GST.\nSo, the program fee with GST calculates to INR 1,50,000 + (18% of 1,50,000) = INR 1,50,000 + INR 27,000 = INR 1,77,000.\nThe booking fee with GST calculates to INR 1,500 + (18% of 1,500) = INR 1,500 + INR 270 = INR 1,770.\nThe total sum for the program fee and booking fee without any concession would be INR 1,77,000 + INR 1,770 = INR 1,78,770.\nHowever, if you opt for the full upfront payment, you receive a 5% concession on the program fee. This reduces the program fee component to INR 1,42,500. When you add 18% GST to this discounted program fee, it comes to INR 1,42,500 + INR 25,650 = INR 1,68,150.\nAdding the booking fee with GST (INR 1,770) to this, the **total upfront payment with the 5% concession would be INR 1,69,920.** The figure of 1,73,250 you mentioned earlier might have been an estimate or based on a slightly different calculation, but this is the precise breakdown as per our current program data.\nNow, regarding your request for a 'pakka' job guarantee and a clear ROI. It's crucial to understand that while we provide comprehensive placement assistance and opportunities, no educational institution can ethically or realistically offer a direct job guarantee for an individual. The final selection will always depend on your personal performance during interviews and the specific requirements of the employer, which is a standard aspect of any hiring process.\nWhat the \"Building Agentic AI Systems\" program *does* guarantee is providing you with the skills, tools, and practical experience to be highly competitive in the job market. You will:\n*   Engage in over 60% hands-on coding and practical activities, developing a strong portfolio of working Agentic AI projects.\n*   Acquire specific, in-demand competencies as outlined in the learning outcomes, such as building conversational AI agents, RAG systems, and multi-agent systems, all designed for job readiness in high-growth AI roles.\n*   Receive placement assistance for eligible learners, which includes up to three interview opportunities within 120 days, career guidance, and preparation sessions. The fact that 97% of our eligible learners were placed indicates the strong success rate of this approach in helping graduates secure roles.\nThe ROI from this program comes from investing in these industry-relevant skills and building a demonstrable portfolio, which are the foundations for career advancement and potential salary growth in the evolving AI and automation sectors. Our focus is to equip you with the capabilities that employers are actively seeking.\nDoes this detailed clarification address your concerns about the exact pricing and the nature of the placement support?",

To help you further evaluate the significant return on investment this program offers, let's now explore exactly what you will be learning and how the program is structured to make you job-ready.\nThe \"Building Agentic AI Systems\" program is meticulously designed across 75 learning sprints, totaling 300 hours of guided learning and practice. It bridges software engineering and applied AI system development, guiding learners from building clean APIs to designing intelligent, autonomous agents. You'll cover essential modules like 'Python for AI Embedded Applications,' 'Build and Deploy Intelligent Conversational Agents,' 'Build RAG Based Systems,' and 'Build Autonomous Multi-agent Systems,' culminating in a Capstone Project to 'Engineer an Autonomous Agentic AI System (SLO-Bound).' This curriculum is practitioner-designed to accelerate skill acquisition, ensuring you gain hands-on, industry-relevant experience.\nIn terms of commitment, you'll be dedicating approximately 12-16 hours per week. Each sprint involves 2 hours of live mentor-led sessions and 2 hours of self-paced practice, with either 3 or 4 sprints per week depending on the batch duration. This translates to around 19 weeks for 4 sprints per week, or 25 weeks for 3 sprints per week. Importantly, over 60% of your program time is invested in coding and hands-on practical activities, allowing you to build a strong portfolio of working AI projects, which is a key component of your ROI.

For eligible learners who complete the program with at least a 70% score, hold a regular graduation degree, and reside in India, placement assistance is available. This support includes up to three interview opportunities within 120 days for those with 6 months to 5 years of experience, career guidance for those with over 5 years of experience, and access to placement preparation sessions and mentor guidance. While NIIT provides these opportunities, final selection depends on your performance and employer requirements. According to our data, 97% of eligible learners were placed.\nNow, concerning the program fee and any hidden charges. The program fee is INR 1,50,000 + GST, along with a booking fee of INR 1,500 + GST. These are the stated fees from NIIT, and there are no hidden charges. We offer multiple payment options:\n*   If you choose to pay the full program fee upfront, there's a 5% concession, making the program fee component INR 1,42,500 + GST.\n*   EMI options are available for INR 24,750 in equal installments after booking.\n*   Additionally, loan facilities can be availed through third-party lenders. It's important to note that loan approval depends on the lender's eligibility criteria, and NIIT does not guarantee loan approval. All loan terms, including EMIs, interest rates, and repayment schedules, are to be reviewed carefully with the lender directly.\nDoes this clarify your initial concerns about the program's value proposition, placement assistance, and fee structure?",

Ye confusion kyun hai?\nAur job prospects ka scene... aap bol rahe ho \"placement assistance\" aur \"up to three interview opportunities,\" aur \"97% eligible learners placed.\" Theek hai, sounds good on paper. Par bhai, \"final selection depends on your performance and employer requirements\" - ye toh sab bolte hain! Iska matlab kya hai? Agar main course acchi tarah complete karta hoon, 70% score bhi le aata hoon, toh kya guarantee hai ki mujhe job milegi?\nSirf assistance ya opportunities se kya hoga, agar end mein job na mile? Mujhe \"pakka\" job guarantee chahiye, ya at least ek clear ROI. Itna time aur itne paise lagane ke baad, I can't afford to just get \"assistance\" and then be on my own. Iska scene kya hai, clear karo. Job Guarantee aur exact total price, ye do abhi bhi mere main unresolved concerns hain.",

      "content": "Thank you for pointing out the figure confusion; I apologize for any misunderstanding. Let me clarify the exact program fee with GST for you.\nThe standard program fee is INR 1,50,000, and the booking fee is INR 1,500. Both are subject to 18% GST.\nSo, the program fee with GST calculates to INR 1,50,000 + (18% of 1,50,000) = INR 1,50,000 + INR 27,000 = INR 1,77,000.\nThe booking fee with GST calculates to INR 1,500 + (18% of 1,500) = INR 1,500 + INR 270 = INR 1,770.\nThe total sum for the program fee and booking fee without any concession would be INR 1,77,000 + INR 1,770 = INR 1,78,770.\nHowever, if you opt for the full upfront payment, you receive a 5% concession on the program fee. This reduces the program fee component to INR 1,42,500. When you add 18% GST to this discounted program fee, it comes to INR 1,42,500 + INR 25,650 = INR 1,68,150.\nAdding the booking fee with GST (INR 1,770) to this, the **total upfront payment with the 5% concession would be INR 1,69,920.** The figure of 1,73,250 you mentioned earlier might have been an estimate or based on a slightly different calculation, but this is the precise breakdown as per our current program data.\nNow, regarding your request for a 'pakka' job guarantee and a clear ROI. It's crucial to understand that while we provide comprehensive placement assistance and opportunities, no educational institution can ethically or realistically offer a direct job guarantee for an individual. The final selection will always depend on your personal performance during interviews and the specific requirements of the employer, which is a standard aspect of any hiring process.\nWhat the \"Building Agentic AI Systems\" program *does* guarantee is providing you with the skills, tools, and practical experience to be highly competitive in the job market. You will:\n*   Engage in over 60% hands-on coding and practical activities, developing a strong portfolio of working Agentic AI projects.\n*   Acquire specific, in-demand competencies as outlined in the learning outcomes, such as building conversational AI agents, RAG systems, and multi-agent systems, all designed for job readiness in high-growth AI roles.\n*   Receive placement assistance for eligible learners, which includes up to three interview opportunities within 120 days, career guidance, and preparation sessions. The fact that 97% of our eligible learners were placed indicates the strong success rate of this approach in helping graduates secure roles.\nThe ROI from this program comes from investing in these industry-relevant skills and building a demonstrable portfolio, which are the foundations for career advancement and potential salary growth in the evolving AI and automation sectors. Our focus is to equip you with the capabilities that employers are actively seeking.\nDoes this detailed clarification address your concerns about the exact pricing and the nature of the placement support?",
