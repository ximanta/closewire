It's completely natural to feel that way when seeing your peers progress, and our 'Building Agentic AI Systems' program is specifically designed for job-readiness in these roles.\nRegarding your question about a job guarantee, it's important to clarify that while NIIT does not offer a job guarantee, we provide comprehensive placement assistance to eligible learners. This support includes access to NIIT's trusted recruiter network and our 800+ hiring partners. For learners with 6 months to 5 years of experience, we facilitate up to three interview opportunities within 120 days of program completion. We also offer career guidance for those with over 5 years of experience, along with placement preparation sessions and mentor guidance. Final selection, of course, depends on your performance and the employer's requirements. We're proud to share that 97% of our eligible learners are placed.\nNow, coming to the program fee, which you mentioned is a concern, the total program fee is INR 1,50,000 + GST, with a booking fee of INR 1,500 + GST. However, we have several options to make it more manageable. If you opt for a full upfront payment, you receive a 5% concession, bringing the fee to INR 1,42,500 inclusive of the concession. Alternatively, an EMI option is available, with payments such as INR 24,750 in equal installments after booking. We also facilitate loan facilities through third-party lenders, offering easy financing without moratorium, though approval depends on the lender's eligibility criteria, and NIIT does not guarantee loan approval. We can discuss these financing options in more detail if you'd like.\nDoes this initial information address your primary concerns about placement support and the program fee, or would you like to explore any of these points further?",
