When I say \"actual engineering depth,\" I mean things like: are we talking about designing robust, scalable architectures for these \"Agentic AI Systems\"? Or is it just stitching together APIs with some Python scripts? My concern is that this is simply glorified automation, perhaps with some fancy new libraries, but fundamentally not requiring the deep engineering acumen I've built over 15 years.\nHow does this program ensure a tangible ROI for someone at my level? How will it directly translate into a significant package hike and more critical project allocations? I need to see how this isn't just a fad, but a foundational shift that warrants my time and investment. Tell me, what are the *advanced software engineering principles* that are being applied here, beyond just the surface-level buzzwords like \"Agentic AI\" or \"LLMs\"? What about the effort/time commitment versus the actual benefit for a senior professional?

They are just repeating my words and not providing answers. This is exactly what stresses me out – wasting time with vague discussions. My resistance is definitely going up. I need concrete examples, not just marketing jargon. \"Agentic AI\" still sounds like a fancy name for scripting to me.
