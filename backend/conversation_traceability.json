Regarding the placement guarantee, NIIT provides placement assistance, not a guarantee. For learners like yourself with 0.5 to 5 years of experience who achieve a 70% assessment score, we offer up to 3 interview opportunities within 120 days through our network of 800+ hiring partners. While a career gap is part of your history, the program is designed to shift the focus to your future capabilities by building a portfolio with 25+ tools like LangChain, CrewAI, and FastAPI.\nThe fee of ₹1,50,000 plus GST is indeed an investment in your upskilling, which is why we offer EMI options starting at ₹24,750 per month or a 5% discount for full upfront payment to make it more manageable. Regarding the syllabus, the program uses a \"Mastery Learning\" methodology with 300 hours of guided learning across 75 sprints. This structure is specifically designed to help you move from a testing background to a development role through 60% hands-on coding and a capstone project. As long as you have a basic foundation in Python, Java, or JS, the 12 to 16 hours of weekly commitment will provide the structured path you need. Does the EMI option help in easing your financial concerns while you consider this transition?",

Sir, to be very honest, I am coming from a manual background. My coding is a bit rusty. If I am not able to keep up with the speed of the batch or if I fail the assessments, what will happen to my fees? Is the Python part taught from very basic level, Sir?

      "content": "Aniket, I understand that as a middle-class professional, ₹1.5 Lakhs plus GST is a significant commitment, and your anxiety regarding the \"Manual Tester\" label is valid. However, the reason the industry values this program is that it shifts your profile from \"testing\" to \"AI Engineering\" through practical evidence. When you apply to product companies, you won't just be showing a certificate; you will be showing a portfolio of production-grade systems, such as Multi-Agent Software Customer Support and RAG-based pipelines. Our 97% placement rate for eligible learners is a result of this project-heavy approach, which helps 800+ hiring partners see your current technical capability rather than just your past roles or career gaps.\nRegarding the syllabus and your coding skills, the program is designed for those with at least 6 months of programming experience. The first module, \"Python for AI Embedded Applications,\" specifically bridges the gap to ensure you are ready for advanced AI orchestration. The \"Mastery Learning\" methodology is structured into 4-hour sprints—where 2 hours are live with a mentor and 2 hours are self-paced—specifically so that you can clarify doubts immediately and not fall behind. As long as you can commit 12 to 16 hours a week, the 70% assessment score is a reachable target intended to ensure you are actually job-ready for the 3 interview opportunities we provide. To reduce the immediate financial pressure on your family, would you like to explore the EMI options or the third-party loan facilities that can spread this cost over several months?",

For learners like yourself with 0.5 to 5 years of experience who achieve a 70% assessment score, we offer up to 3 interview opportunities within 120 days through our network of 800+ hiring partners. While a career gap is part of your history, the program is designed to shift the focus to your future capabilities by building a portfolio with 25+ tools like LangChain, CrewAI, and FastAPI.\nThe fee of ₹1,50,000 plus GST is indeed an investment in your upskilling, which is why we offer EMI options starting at ₹24,750 per month or a 5% discount for full upfront payment to make it more manageable. Regarding the syllabus, the program uses a \"Mastery Learning\" methodology with 300 hours of guided learning across 75 sprints. This structure is specifically designed to help you move from a testing background to a development role through 60% hands-on coding and a capstone project. As long as you have a basic foundation in Python, Java, or JS, the 12 to 16 hours of weekly commitment will provide the structured path you need. Does the EMI option help in easing your financial concerns while you consider this transition?",

Sir, if I don't get a placement after spending this much, my family will be in a very difficult position.\nSir, you mentioned that for 2020 passing out batch students like me, the focus will shift. But Sir, will the NIIT certificate really have that much 'scope' in the market? Will the big product companies really ignore my 1-year career gap and my 4 years of manual testing experience just by seeing this certificate? I am very scared that they will see 'Manual Tester' on my resume and reject me immediately.\nAlso Sir, about the syllabus... you mentioned 75 sprints and 60% hands-on coding. Sir, to be very honest, I am coming from a manual background. My coding is a bit rusty. If I am not able to keep up with the speed of the batch or if I fail the assessments, what will happen to my fees? Is the Python part taught from very basic level, Sir?

      "content": "Aniket, I understand that as a middle-class professional, ₹1.5 Lakhs plus GST is a significant commitment, and your anxiety regarding the \"Manual Tester\" label is valid. However, the reason the industry values this program is that it shifts your profile from \"testing\" to \"AI Engineering\" through practical evidence. When you apply to product companies, you won't just be showing a certificate; you will be showing a portfolio of production-grade systems, such as Multi-Agent Software Customer Support and RAG-based pipelines. Our 97% placement rate for eligible learners is a result of this project-heavy approach, which helps 800+ hiring partners see your current technical capability rather than just your past roles or career gaps.\nRegarding the syllabus and your coding skills, the program is designed for those with at least 6 months of programming experience. The first module, \"Python for AI Embedded Applications,\" specifically bridges the gap to ensure you are ready for advanced AI orchestration. The \"Mastery Learning\" methodology is structured into 4-hour sprints—where 2 hours are live with a mentor and 2 hours are self-paced—specifically so that you can clarify doubts immediately and not fall behind. As long as you can commit 12 to 16 hours a week, the 70% assessment score is a reachable target intended to ensure you are actually job-ready for the 3 interview opportunities we provide. To reduce the immediate financial pressure on your family, would you like to explore the EMI options or the third-party loan facilities that can spread this cost over several months?",
