      "content": "It's great to hear that you're looking for a program that can advance your career and provide good placement support. Those are important considerations.\nRegarding your questions about the program's intensity and requirements: The 'Building Agentic AI Systems' program is designed with a mastery learning methodology, focusing on developing one skill at a time through structured, hands-on sprints. Each sprint involves 2 hours of live mentor-led sessions and 2 hours of self-paced practice. Depending on whether you choose 3 or 4 sprints per week, your weekly commitment would be approximately 12 to 16 hours, with about 70% of that time dedicated to hands-on work. The program totals 75 sprints, or 300 hours of guided learning and practice, typically spanning 19 to 25 weeks.\nTo successfully complete the program and receive your industry-recognized NIIT Certificate in Agentic AI, you would need to maintain at least 90% attendance, achieve 70% or higher marks in assessments, and ensure full fee payment. It's built for learners with at least six months of hands-on experience in a modern programming language, so a foundational understanding is expected, but the structured format is designed to guide you through complex topics.\nNow, regarding placement support, it's an important aspect for many of our learners. Placement assistance is available for eligible learners who complete the program with at least a 70% score, hold a regular graduation degree, and reside in India. For those with 6 months to 5 years of experience, this support includes access to placement preparation sessions, mentor guidance, and up to three interview opportunities within 120 days. For learners with over 5 years of experience, career guidance is provided. It's important to understand that while we facilitate these opportunities, the final selection always depends on your individual performance during interviews and the specific requirements of the employer. We focus on building job-ready capabilities and a strong portfolio of working AI projects, demonstrating your readiness for applied AI development roles upon completion.",

      "content": "I understand your concerns about the time commitment, the attendance and marks requirements, and particularly about the job guarantee. It's natural to want to ensure your investment in time and money yields the desired career outcome.\nRegarding the program's intensity and the requirements: The 300 hours of guided learning and practice, spread over 19 to 25 weeks, is indeed a significant commitment. However, this structure, with 70% hands-on work, is specifically designed as an \"Outcome-Driven Program\" and \"Practitioner Designed\" to build job-ready competencies. The 90% attendance and 70% assessment marks are set to ensure that learners fully engage with this rigorous methodology and truly master the skills, which is crucial for receiving the industry-recognized NIIT Certificate in Agentic AI and becoming eligible for placement assistance. These requirements ensure you develop a strong foundation.\nRegarding the prerequisite experience: The program is designed for learners with at least six months of hands-on experience in a modern programming language like Python, Java, JavaScript, or C#. This foundational experience in writing and debugging simple programs, working with APIs, and understanding web applications is important because the 'Building Agentic AI Systems' curriculum quickly moves into complex topics like designing intelligent, autonomous agents and building RAG-based systems. While the program’s \"Mastery Learning methodology\" is structured to guide you through, this prerequisite ensures you have the base to absorb the advanced concepts and apply the tools and frameworks effectively. If you do not meet this eligibility, it would be advisable to discuss your background with a Program Advisor to ensure the best fit for your success.\nNow, concerning the \"placement guarantee\": As a Senior Admissions Counsellor, I must be clear and factual. We do not promise guaranteed jobs. What we provide is robust \"placement assistance\" for eligible learners. This means that if you meet the criteria—completing the program with at least a 70% score, holding a regular graduation degree, and residing in India—you will receive specific support. This includes access to placement preparation sessions, mentor guidance, and for those with 6 months to 5 years of experience, up to three interview opportunities within 120 days. For learners with over 5 years of experience, career guidance is provided. Our focus is on ensuring you are \"Built for Job Readiness\" and can \"Showcase a portfolio of working AI projects demonstrating readiness for applied AI development roles.\" The final selection for any role, however, always depends on your individual performance during interviews and the specific requirements of the employer. Our objective is to equip you with the skills and the demonstrated capability to excel in these opportunities.",

      "content": "I hear your reservations clearly regarding the prerequisite experience, the job guarantee, and the program fee. These are significant points, and it's essential that you have a full understanding to make an informed decision.\nFirst, regarding the six months of programming experience: The program's 'Practitioner Designed' curriculum and 'Mastery Learning methodology' are built upon the assumption of this foundational experience. The curriculum quickly advances to designing intelligent, autonomous agents, building RAG-based systems, and orchestrating multi-agent systems using specific tools like Python, FastAPI, OpenAI SDK, LangChain, and CrewAI. About 70% of your time will be hands-on, requiring you to write and debug code, work with APIs, and build web applications right from the start. Without this prerequisite, you might indeed find it very challenging to keep pace with the learning sprints, fully engage with the complex topics, and ultimately achieve the required 70% assessment marks and build the necessary portfolio of working AI projects. While the program is structured for rigorous learning, success heavily relies on meeting these entry-level competencies. For this reason, we strongly advise learners to have this background to ensure they can truly thrive. If you feel you might not meet this, I would recommend connecting with a Program Advisor who can assess your specific background and guide you on the best path forward, which might include building up those foundational skills first.\nNow, regarding placement. As I mentioned, we provide robust 'placement assistance' for eligible learners, which is a key feature of our 'Built for Job Readiness' approach. This includes access to placement preparation sessions, mentor guidance, and up to three interview opportunities within 120 days for those with 6 months to 5 years of experience. Our commitment is to equip you with an \"exit profile\" that includes the ability to design and orchestrate multi-agent systems and \"showcase a portfolio of working AI projects demonstrating readiness for applied AI development roles.\" This program is outcome-driven, designed to build role-specific competencies that are highly valued in the industry. The final selection, however, is always based on your individual performance in interviews and the specific requirements of the hiring employer. We focus on empowering you with the skills and demonstrable projects that make you a competitive candidate in the high-growth AI and automation job market, rather than guaranteeing a specific job outcome.\nFinally, addressing your concern about the program fee. The investment of 1,50,000 INR plus GST, or the EMI option of 24,750 INR after booking, covers 300 hours of guided, mentor-led learning, mastery of 25+ cutting-edge tools and frameworks, and the development of a strong portfolio through industry-relevant projects. This program is positioned to develop 'job-ready capabilities for high-growth AI and automation roles' and 'design Agentic AI systems that accelerate innovation.' Many learners find this investment worthwhile because it directly translates into acquiring highly specialized and in-demand skills. To make this investment more accessible, we do offer EMI options, including through third-party lenders. These options can help spread the cost over a period, making it more manageable. Would you like me to share more details on the available financing options?",

It's important to clarify these points fully to help you make the right decision.\nFirst, regarding the six months of programming experience: You are correct that it is explicitly stated as \"important\" and \"foundational.\" The program's design, which allocates approximately 70% of its 300 hours to hands-on work, assumes learners can immediately engage with writing and debugging code, working with REST APIs and JSON, and building web applications using frameworks. The curriculum quickly progresses to complex topics like designing intelligent conversational agents, building RAG-based systems, and orchestrating multi-agent systems using advanced tools and frameworks such as LangChain, CrewAI, and Azure AI Foundry. Without this foundational experience, you would indeed likely find it very challenging to keep pace, understand the advanced concepts, and effectively complete the hands-on projects necessary to achieve the required 70% assessment marks and build a strong portfolio. Our goal is for your success, and meeting the eligibility criteria is crucial for that. I strongly recommend connecting with a Program Advisor who can assess your specific background and guide you on whether this program is the right fit for your current skill level, or if building those foundational skills first would be more beneficial.\nNow, concerning the job guarantee: As a Senior Admissions Counsellor, I must reiterate that we do not offer guaranteed jobs. What we do provide is comprehensive \"placement assistance\" for eligible learners. This support is robust and includes access to placement preparation sessions, mentor guidance, and up to three interview opportunities within 120 days for those with 6 months to 5 years of experience, or career guidance for those with over 5 years of experience, provided you meet the eligibility of a 70% score, a regular graduation degree, and Indian residency.

However, the final selection by an employer always depends on your individual performance during interviews and their specific hiring requirements. Our commitment is to empower you with the in-demand skills and demonstrable projects that make you a highly competitive candidate in the high-growth AI and automation job market.\nRegarding your question about an \"easier program or a shortcut\" to a good job certificate without this level of hard work or experience: The 'Building Agentic AI Systems' program is specifically designed to develop deep, \"job-ready capabilities\" through its rigorous \"Mastery Learning methodology\" and significant hands-on work. This intensity, including the 90% attendance and 70% assessment mark requirements, is what ensures you truly master the 25+ tools and frameworks and can build, document, and test real-world Agentic AI systems. In a rapidly evolving and complex field like AI, shortcuts often do not lead to the comprehensive skill set and practical experience that employers seek for meaningful roles. The 1,50,000 INR plus GST fee reflects the value of 300 hours of guided, mentor-led learning, the cutting-edge curriculum, and the development of a portfolio through industry-relevant projects. This investment is aimed at preparing you for high-growth AI and automation roles by providing specialized and in-demand skills. To help manage this investment, we offer full upfront payment with a concession, or EMI options through third-party lenders, which can make it more accessible.",

      "content": "It's great to hear that you're looking for a program that can advance your career and provide good placement support. Those are important considerations.\nRegarding your questions about the program's intensity and requirements: The 'Building Agentic AI Systems' program is designed with a mastery learning methodology, focusing on developing one skill at a time through structured, hands-on sprints. Each sprint involves 2 hours of live mentor-led sessions and 2 hours of self-paced practice. Depending on whether you choose 3 or 4 sprints per week, your weekly commitment would be approximately 12 to 16 hours, with about 70% of that time dedicated to hands-on work. The program totals 75 sprints, or 300 hours of guided learning and practice, typically spanning 19 to 25 weeks.\nTo successfully complete the program and receive your industry-recognized NIIT Certificate in Agentic AI, you would need to maintain at least 90% attendance, achieve 70% or higher marks in assessments, and ensure full fee payment. It's built for learners with at least six months of hands-on experience in a modern programming language, so a foundational understanding is expected, but the structured format is designed to guide you through complex topics.\nNow, regarding placement support, it's an important aspect for many of our learners. Placement assistance is available for eligible learners who complete the program with at least a 70% score, hold a regular graduation degree, and reside in India. For those with 6 months to 5 years of experience, this support includes access to placement preparation sessions, mentor guidance, and up to three interview opportunities within 120 days. For learners with over 5 years of experience, career guidance is provided. It's important to understand that while we facilitate these opportunities, the final selection always depends on your individual performance during interviews and the specific requirements of the employer. We focus on building job-ready capabilities and a strong portfolio of working AI projects, demonstrating your readiness for applied AI development roles upon completion.",

      "content": "I understand your concerns about the time commitment, the attendance and marks requirements, and particularly about the job guarantee. It's natural to want to ensure your investment in time and money yields the desired career outcome.\nRegarding the program's intensity and the requirements: The 300 hours of guided learning and practice, spread over 19 to 25 weeks, is indeed a significant commitment. However, this structure, with 70% hands-on work, is specifically designed as an \"Outcome-Driven Program\" and \"Practitioner Designed\" to build job-ready competencies. The 90% attendance and 70% assessment marks are set to ensure that learners fully engage with this rigorous methodology and truly master the skills, which is crucial for receiving the industry-recognized NIIT Certificate in Agentic AI and becoming eligible for placement assistance. These requirements ensure you develop a strong foundation.\nRegarding the prerequisite experience: The program is designed for learners with at least six months of hands-on experience in a modern programming language like Python, Java, JavaScript, or C#. This foundational experience in writing and debugging simple programs, working with APIs, and understanding web applications is important because the 'Building Agentic AI Systems' curriculum quickly moves into complex topics like designing intelligent, autonomous agents and building RAG-based systems. While the program’s \"Mastery Learning methodology\" is structured to guide you through, this prerequisite ensures you have the base to absorb the advanced concepts and apply the tools and frameworks effectively. If you do not meet this eligibility, it would be advisable to discuss your background with a Program Advisor to ensure the best fit for your success.\nNow, concerning the \"placement guarantee\": As a Senior Admissions Counsellor, I must be clear and factual. We do not promise guaranteed jobs. What we provide is robust \"placement assistance\" for eligible learners. This means that if you meet the criteria—completing the program with at least a 70% score, holding a regular graduation degree, and residing in India—you will receive specific support. This includes access to placement preparation sessions, mentor guidance, and for those with 6 months to 5 years of experience, up to three interview opportunities within 120 days. For learners with over 5 years of experience, career guidance is provided. Our focus is on ensuring you are \"Built for Job Readiness\" and can \"Showcase a portfolio of working AI projects demonstrating readiness for applied AI development roles.\" The final selection for any role, however, always depends on your individual performance during interviews and the specific requirements of the employer.

      "content": "I hear your reservations clearly regarding the prerequisite experience, the job guarantee, and the program fee. These are significant points, and it's essential that you have a full understanding to make an informed decision.\nFirst, regarding the six months of programming experience: The program's 'Practitioner Designed' curriculum and 'Mastery Learning methodology' are built upon the assumption of this foundational experience. The curriculum quickly advances to designing intelligent, autonomous agents, building RAG-based systems, and orchestrating multi-agent systems using specific tools like Python, FastAPI, OpenAI SDK, LangChain, and CrewAI. About 70% of your time will be hands-on, requiring you to write and debug code, work with APIs, and build web applications right from the start. Without this prerequisite, you might indeed find it very challenging to keep pace with the learning sprints, fully engage with the complex topics, and ultimately achieve the required 70% assessment marks and build the necessary portfolio of working AI projects. While the program is structured for rigorous learning, success heavily relies on meeting these entry-level competencies. For this reason, we strongly advise learners to have this background to ensure they can truly thrive. If you feel you might not meet this, I would recommend connecting with a Program Advisor who can assess your specific background and guide you on the best path forward, which might include building up those foundational skills first.\nNow, regarding placement. As I mentioned, we provide robust 'placement assistance' for eligible learners, which is a key feature of our 'Built for Job Readiness' approach. This includes access to placement preparation sessions, mentor guidance, and up to three interview opportunities within 120 days for those with 6 months to 5 years of experience. Our commitment is to equip you with an \"exit profile\" that includes the ability to design and orchestrate multi-agent systems and \"showcase a portfolio of working AI projects demonstrating readiness for applied AI development roles.\" This program is outcome-driven, designed to build role-specific competencies that are highly valued in the industry. The final selection, however, is always based on your individual performance in interviews and the specific requirements of the hiring employer. We focus on empowering you with the skills and demonstrable projects that make you a competitive candidate in the high-growth AI and automation job market, rather than guaranteeing a specific job outcome.\nFinally, addressing your concern about the program fee. The investment of 1,50,000 INR plus GST, or the EMI option of 24,750 INR after booking, covers 300 hours of guided, mentor-led learning, mastery of 25+ cutting-edge tools and frameworks, and the development of a strong portfolio through industry-relevant projects. This program is positioned to develop 'job-ready capabilities for high-growth AI and automation roles' and 'design Agentic AI systems that accelerate innovation.' Many learners find this investment worthwhile because it directly translates into acquiring highly specialized and in-demand skills. To make this investment more accessible, we do offer EMI options, including through third-party lenders. These options can help spread the cost over a period, making it more manageable. Would you like me to share more details on the available financing options?",

Without this foundational experience, you would indeed likely find it very challenging to keep pace, understand the advanced concepts, and effectively complete the hands-on projects necessary to achieve the required 70% assessment marks and build a strong portfolio. Our goal is for your success, and meeting the eligibility criteria is crucial for that. I strongly recommend connecting with a Program Advisor who can assess your specific background and guide you on whether this program is the right fit for your current skill level, or if building those foundational skills first would be more beneficial.\nNow, concerning the job guarantee: As a Senior Admissions Counsellor, I must reiterate that we do not offer guaranteed jobs. What we do provide is comprehensive \"placement assistance\" for eligible learners. This support is robust and includes access to placement preparation sessions, mentor guidance, and up to three interview opportunities within 120 days for those with 6 months to 5 years of experience, or career guidance for those with over 5 years of experience, provided you meet the eligibility of a 70% score, a regular graduation degree, and Indian residency.

This intensity, including the 90% attendance and 70% assessment mark requirements, is what ensures you truly master the 25+ tools and frameworks and can build, document, and test real-world Agentic AI systems. In a rapidly evolving and complex field like AI, shortcuts often do not lead to the comprehensive skill set and practical experience that employers seek for meaningful roles. The 1,50,000 INR plus GST fee reflects the value of 300 hours of guided, mentor-led learning, the cutting-edge curriculum, and the development of a portfolio through industry-relevant projects.
